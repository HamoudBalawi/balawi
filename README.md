## Brief

For the login functionality, use either a Wordpress installation with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/" target="_blank">JWT plugin from Module 3</a> installed, or a Strapi installation. Do not add either of these to your repo. Your API should remain a separate project. The markers will use their own installations when marking.

You can use either a REST or GraphQL API for the API calls.
